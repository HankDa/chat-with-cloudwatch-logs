App output:

Log message:
NameError: name 'b' is not defined
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/var/task/lambda_function.py", line 8, in lambda_handler
a = b + 10

Explanation:
The error message indicates that the variable 'b' is not defined in the Lambda function. The function is trying to perform an arithmetic operation with 'b', but 'b' has not been declared or initialized.

Solution:
To fix this issue, you need to define the variable 'b' before using it in the arithmetic operation. You can initialize 'b' with a value or declare it as a global variable if it is defined elsewhere in the code. Here's an example of how you can initialize 'b':

```python
b = 0
a = b + 10
```

Log message:
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/var/task/lambda_function.py", line 8, in lambda_handler
a = 1/0

Explanation:
The error message indicates that the Lambda function is trying to perform a division operation by zero, which is not allowed in mathematics.

Solution:
To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the denominator of the division operation is not zero. You can add a check to verify if the denominator is zero before performing the division operation. Here's an example of how you can modify the code:

```python
denominator = 0
if denominator != 0:
    a = 1 / denominator
else:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
```
```
